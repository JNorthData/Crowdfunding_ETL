# Crowdfunding_ETL
This is Project 2 of our Data Analytics Bootcamp, 'Crowdfunding ETL'.

This project is a collaboration between Jeff North and Adriana Galindo. 

The details of our data cleaning work can be seen in the Jupyter notebook 'ETL_Mini_Project'.

    Parts 1 and 3 were completed by Adriana Galindo.
        - Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
        - Create the Contacts DataFrame

    Part 2 and 4 were completed by Jeff North.
        - Create the Campaign DataFrame
        - Create the Crowdfunding Database

Our cleaned data was used to create 4 tables, which we stored as .csv files in the Resources folder:
    - campaign
    - contact
    - category
    - subcategory

The SQL code for creating a database schema for these tables,
including queries for importing table data from .csv files, is in a file:

    'crowdfunding_db_schema.sql'
